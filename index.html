Blockchain
A chain of blocks that contain information. 
(original named, Digital Timestamps, 1991). But became popular by 'Satoshi Nakamoto' (bitcoin).
Is a distrivuted ledger, accesable to everyone. Very difficult to change information inside a block.
Each block contains
Data
Hash (identifies the block and all of it's content)
Hash of previous block.

If you change a block, the hash(or fingerprint) will change.
[AUDIENCE QUESTION] What's the problem with that?
The link that connects the blocks will be disrupted because the block after it will link to a hash which doesn't exist anymore.
Can still be tampered with if you also recalculate all the other hashes.

How to prevent that?
	Proof-Of-Work(high energy consumption) : Slows down the creation of new blocks. (i.e Bitcoin it takes 10 minutes to create a new block)

	P2P Network : Everyone gets a full copy of the network. New block? Everyone receives it and checks if it hasn't been tampered with. If not, it gets added. CONSENSUS!
		Can be avoided if you have more than 50% of the P2P network.
		

You dont want people to create hundreds of thousands of block per second. Theres also security issue where you change the hash of every block and end up with a valid chain.
To solve this Blockchains have proof-of-work. A lot of computing power needed to create a block (= mining).
